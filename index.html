  <h2>From Global Superstar to a Divided Internet</h2>
    <p>When you think of female musicians, one of the first people you may think of is Taylor Swift. With 14 Grammy awards, record-breaking album sales, and the highest-grossing concert tour in history, her name is extremely well-known in the modern music industry. Whether you’re a die-hard fan or a casual listener, one way or another, you have heard of her. But how much of her fame and success translates into public approval? How does the internet actually feel about her?  </p>

  <h2>Fame Under a Microscope</h2>
   <p>To explore this question, we turned to social media, where people are able to share opinions freely. We have gathered and analyzed posts mentioning Taylor Swift, from her own account to posts mentioning her. Through web scraping and text analysis, we examined whether the overall sentiment was more positive, negative, or neutral. From excitement or disappointment over her newest releases, the data offers a new perspective on how one of the world’s most recognizable artists is perceived through social media, specifically TikTok.</p>

<iframe title="Sentiment Breakdown of Taylor Swift's Social Media" aria-label="Small multiple pie chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Xc9ZH" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Xc9ZH/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="325" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>
  <br>
  
  <p>Looking at the figure on the left, the data paints a clear picture: the majority of posts mentioning Taylor Swift are overwhelmingly positive. With more than 60% being positive, it is clear that the numbers on her charts and listeners translate to the amount of support she receives on social media. Negative and neutral posts are equal at about 19.6%. They show that while not everyone may be a fan, Taylor Swift’s reputation is highly favorable.</p>

  <p>While more than half of posts are positive, the comments under these posts tell a slightly different story. The figure on the right depicts Taylor’s comments section, finding that the amount of neutral comments rises to about a third (33.5%), while negative comments also increase to about 21.5%. This shift can reveal how engagement differs across TikTok. People who dislike an artist like Taylor Swift may not take the time to create a post, but leaving a quick hate comment is easier. Comment sections provide a low-effort way to share your opinions, especially criticism. In other words, while the posts are largely positive, comments and replies may reflect people’s more honest feelings.</p>

  <h2>The Divide Behind The Life of a Showgirl</h2>
  <p>Taylor Swift herself has a large social media presence and following, where she posts updates on her new music, tour dates, and any new promotional items with her fans. Recently, she released her new and highly anticipated album, The Life of a Showgirl (TLOASG), which sparked a noticeable and strong divide among listeners. Recognizing that comments reveal more than the posts themselves, we took a deeper dive into Taylor Swift’s comment section before and after the release of her new album to see if they reflect what people think about her new music.</p>
  
  <br>
  <iframe title="Sentiment Breakdown of Taylor Swift's Comment Section Before vs After The Life Of a Show Girl's Release" aria-label="Small multiple pie chart" id="datawrapper-chart-qv0AQ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qv0AQ/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="334" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>
  <br>
  
  <p>As shown in the chart on the left, the tone prior to the release of Taylor Swift’s comment section had a balance with nearly an equal amount of positive (45.5%) and neutral (44.6%) comments, and only 10% classified as negative. It is worth noting, however, that some speculate that Swift’s team may remove overly negative comments, which is common for public figures. This has not been confirmed, but this possibility raises the question of whether our data is completely accurate or not. Still, the amount of negative comments help highlight the shift in tone and gives insight into how people feel after TLOASG’s release.</p>

  <p>Following the long anticipated release of TLOASG, the tone in Taylor Swift’s comment section has once again shifted, but not for the better. Through the chart on the right, we see that while the amount of positive and neutral comments still maintains a relatively even split, both have decreased overall, making room for the noticeable increase in negativity. Neutrality now leads, suggesting that listeners may not know how they feel about the album and this new era of hers. The increase in negativity may answer our question on people’s opinions on this new album, but it can also reflect an overly high standard that people have put on Taylor Swift. As she continues to grow in the spotlight, so do audiences and their critics against her.</p>

  <h2>How Does this New Era Compare?</h2>
  <p>Many fans continue to celebrate the album’s release, praising its sound and Swift’s ability to reinvent herself and create a new era with each record. Others, however, debate on if this new era has lived up to her previous work. Some argue the production feels too similar to other people’s work, and the lyrics lack a sort of depth she has shown before in albums such as Folklore or Evermore. Yet, even among all critics, there needs to be recognition in her work ethic and continuous influence on the music industry. Whether people love her or not, everyone has their own opinion on Taylor Swift. Maybe it’s worth taking a look at her comments yourself, listening to the album, scrolling through posts, and deciding where your own opinion falls: with the majority or the minority.</p>
